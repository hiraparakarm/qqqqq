         <h1>Operation Sindoor</h1>
         <img src="C:\Users\Students\Pictures\Saved Pictures\sindoor.jpeg">
         <p>In an age of multi-domain warfare, where threats evolve faster than borders shift, India's national security architecture has demonstrated the strength of jointness and strategic foresight.
            Operation SINDOOR, initiated on May 7, 2025, in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent civilians showcased a calibrated, tri-services response that embodied precision, professionalism, and purpose.
            Operation SINDOOR was conceived as a punitive and targeted campaign to dismantle the terror infrastructure across the Line of Control and deeper inside Pakistan.

            "Operation Sindoor" refers to a series of strikes carried out by the Indian Armed Forces on May 7, 2025, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation was a response to a "barbaric" terrorist attack in Pahalgam, where 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen were killed, and aimed to dismantle terror camps and neutralize terrorists likely to be sent across the border. It was described as a measured, non-escalatory response, focusing on terrorist targets rather than Pakistani military facilities.
